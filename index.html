	<p>
I am a graduating bachelor with 8 years of professional software industry experience in the fields of data science, predictive analytics, and mobile/web development. I have a passion for creating amazing products and uncovering hidden truths within data. My key areas of interests include data mining, data visualization and API software development. I am not tied to any specific technologies as I believe each task requires tools tailored to the problem at hand. Because of this, I am very quick to learn new methods and techniques for solving problems. I am driven to take on new problems and expand my horizons.
